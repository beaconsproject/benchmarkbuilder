# benchmarkbuilder
Calls BUILDER software from R

In development, currently the BUILDER software is not publically available so the package will only work for developers who can add the BUILDER software locally to an exec folder.

## Installation
Github packages can be installed using the devtools `install_github()` function. Call the following from an R console.

`install.packages('devtools')`

`devtools::install_github("beaconsproject/benchmarkbuilder")`
